# Description:
Dermatology is one in all the foremost
unpredictable and difficult terrains to diagnose due its quality.
within the field of dermatology, many another times in depth
tests square measure to be administered thus as to decide upon
the skin condition the patient is also facing. The time might vary
from practician to practician. This is also supported the expertise
of that person too. So, there is a need of a system which might
diagnose the skin diseases while not any of those constraints.
we tend to propose an automatic image based mostly system
for recognition of skin diseases exploitation machine learning
classification. this technique can utilize process technique to
analyze, process, and relegate the image information predicated
on numerous options of the pictures. Skin pictures square measure filtered to remove unwanted noise and additionally method
it for sweetening of the image. Feature extraction exploitation
advanced techniques like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),
classify the image based mostly on the algorithmic rule of softmax
classifier and acquire the identification report as associate degree
output. this technique can provide additional accuracy and can
generate results quicker than the normal technique, creating this
application associate degree economical and dependable system
for dermatologic disease detection. moreover, this could even be
used as a reliable real time teaching tool for medical students
within the medicine stream.
